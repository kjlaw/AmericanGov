American Government Website
===========================

(Created in 2013)

I created this website for a teacher to make learning about the American government fun for early elementary school students. This website features interactive graphics that “pop-up” to reveal more information about certain topics. Students are also able to download activities and homework assignments from the website. Phillip Martin’s artwork was used extensively to create this site.
